# RESTful Blog API
The assignment lab for this module is to build a RESTful Blog API. Most often, servers have complex logic and business relations. This lab will solidify your Express skills and also allow you to practice splitting routes into multiple files for better code organisation. The goal is to have a very small main file (server.js) which will allow you to work easily on very large Express projects.
